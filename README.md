# Serverless Google Cloud Functions Plugin

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/serverless/serverless-google-cloudfunctions/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/serverless/serverless-google-cloudfunctions?branch=master)

This plugin enables support for [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) within the [Serverless Framework](https://github.com/serverless/serverless).


## Why is this fork AWESOME?

This repo is a fork of the official [Serverless Google Cloud Functions](https://github.com/serverless/serverless-google-cloudfunctions),
but adds extra features

### Upgrade to Google Cloud Functions V1 and NodeJS V8

Google Cloud Functions recently got out of beta. This fork now uses their v1 instead of v1beta1.
It also supports the NodeJS V8 environment, which is the default one.

To override, you can set the `provider.runtime: nodejs6` option.

### Region

Since it's out of beta, it now supports more than one region.

You can set it with the `provier.region: us-central1` option.

See https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/locations for supported locations.

### Stating

In the `serverless.yml`, you can add `prependService` and `prependStage` to the `provider` key.

For example, the configuration below

```
service: users

provider:
  name: google
  runtime: nodejs6
  project: <project-id>
  credentials: <credentials>
  stage: purple
  prependService: true
  prependStage: true

functions:
  login:
    handler: login
    entryPoint: login
    events:
      - http: path
```

will deploy your Google Cloud Function with:

`name: my-awesome-service-purple-login`

`handler: login` // Note that the handler is not affected

`trigger: https://us-central1-<project-id>.cloudfunctions.net/users-purple-login `

### Retry on Failure

It also adds an option to retry background jobs upon failure:
```
functions:
  email:
    handler: email
    entryPoint: send
    events:
      - event:
          eventType: providers/cloud.pubsub/eventTypes/topic.publish
          resource: projects/${self:provider.project}/topics/${self:provider.stage}-new-account
          retry: true
```

### Environment Variables

Use the `environment` option to set environment variables.

It can be set at the `provider` level, or at the `function` level, or at both.


```
service: users

provider:
  name: google
  runtime: nodejs6
  project: <project-id>
  credentials: <credentials>
  stage: purple
  prependService: true
  prependStage: true
  environment:
    KEY: my-dev-key
    LANG: ca

functions:
  login:
    handler: login
    entryPoint: login
    events:
      - http: path
    environment:
      KEY: my-prod-key
```


The function `login` will have the environment variables as:

```
KEY: my-prod-key
LANG: ca
```

### Service account
Usage:
```
functions:
  example:
    serviceAccount: <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>
```

### VPC Connector
Simple example:
```
functions:
  example:
    vpcConnector: <VPC_CONNECTOR_NAME>
```

Setting egress settings:
```
functions:
  example:
    vpcConnector: <VPC_CONNECTOR_NAME>
    vpcConnectorEgressSettings: "ALL_TRAFFIC" | "PRIVATE_RANGES_ONLY"
```

When `vcpConnector` is set, `vpcConnectorEgressSettings` is set to `ALL_TRAFFIC` by default.
